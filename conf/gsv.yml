  # GSV_WEIGHTS_PATH is needed, even if you do not really take advantage of this feature.
  WEIGHTS_PATH: "%CONFIGURATION.HPC_PROJECT_DIR%/gsv_files/gsv_weights"
  # GSV_TEST_FILES is only needed if you want to run the pytest suite for GSV.
  # We could omit this in the workflow calls.
  TEST_FILES: "%CONFIGURATION.HPC_PROJECT_DIR%/gsv_files/gsv_test_files"
  # GRID_DEFINITION_PATH is needed for reading native grids like tco, eORCA...
  # If we are only reading healpix in the workflow (or regular_ll in case of the reduced output) maybe it's not necessary.
