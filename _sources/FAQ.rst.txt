Where are my logs? And my scripts?
----------------------------------

Your experiment in the Virtual Machine contains different directories. One of them is ``tmp``, that has also two subdirectories.

There, you can find three types of files:
- ``.cmd``: scripts generated by Autosubmit, applying the configuration to the templates. The placeholders are substituted. Those are the scripts submitted. Don't edit them, it won't work! They are re-generated each time that autosubmit runs.
- ``.err``: standard error logs of each job.
- ``.out``: standard output logs of each job.

In ``ASLOGS`` you can see the output and logs of each autosubmit command that was performed to an experiment.


My workflow failed! What can I do?
----------------------------------

It might happen that a job of the workflow fails. The first thing that you should check is the job's log. They will be located here: ``$expid/tmp/LOG_$expid``. Every job has two log files: a ``.err`` and a ``.out``. Check the both of them, and once you find and fix the error, perform ``autosubmit create $expid`` and ``autosubmit run $expid`` in order to re-run the **whole** workflow.

If the job failed **but you don't want to rerun the whole workflow, just restart the last job that failed,** you can perform, for example:

``autosubmit setstatus <expid> -fs FAILED -t READY -s``

And then ``autosubmit run <expid>``. You **don't** have to create again.
If you don't understand why your job failed, don't hesitate to contact us!

How can I update my application?
--------------------------------

See the `Update Apps` section.


Which is the best wrapper configuration?
----------------------------------------

There's no universal answer but unless there is an issue preventing doing so, like the model frequently crashing and Autosubmit unable to keep the allocations open and apply re-trials within the wrappers, we should go for wrappers as long as possible.
For example, the waiting time is probably not going to be larger with 72h than with 24h (since if the machine was full I doubt the 24hours job fill in the gaps with backfilling), so once you wait, try to run as much as possible before the next queuing time.
